# Gau Mitra
AI-powered Indian Cow Breed Recognition system using Machine Learning and Flask. Includes model, prediction page, and database.
GauMitra is an AI-powered web application designed to identify Indian cow breeds using deep learning and transfer learning techniques. The system takes an uploaded image of a cow, processes it using a trained machine learning model, and returns the predicted breed along with relevant information retrieved from a small integrated database. The goal of GauMitra is to assist farmers, students, and researchers by providing a fast and accessible breed recognition tool through a simple web interface.

Built using Python, Flask, TensorFlow, and OpenCV, GauMitra combines a lightweight backend with an easy-to-use HTML/CSS frontend. The project includes a prediction page, a homepage, and utilities for managing the database.
